The increase in revenue starts in the month of September. This trend continues till the month of November where it reached 1.37 million USD, the highest during the entire year.

The visual shows how the top 10 countries which have opportunities for growth are performing. The analysis shows that, countries such as the Netherlands, Ireland, Germany and France have high volumes of units bought and revenue generated. 

3] 𝐂𝐮𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐫 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬 :
The analysis shows that, there is not much of a difference between the purchases made by the top 10 customers. The highest revenue generating customer only purchased 7% more than the 2nd highest which shows that the business is not relying only on a few customers to generate the revenue. This shows that, the bargaining power of customers is low and the business is in a good position.

 It can be seen that, countries such as Netherlands, Ireland, Germany, France and Australia are generating high revenue and the company should invest more in these areas to increase demand for products. Africa and Asia do not have any demand for the products, along with Russia.
